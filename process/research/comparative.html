                    I am aiming to make a project out of creating awareness of water pollution through interactive web 
                    experiences catered to kids. This project by Lien AID made a similar concept of creating a mobile game 
                    to represent water pollution in its simpler form. It has similar ideas to my concept by using examples 
                    such as avoiding the dumping of trash and plastic materials into the ocean with the result of consequences 
                    of either notifications or deduction of points stating a message that it is showing a negative impact into 
                    the ocean. My concept differs and adds to this example by adding sea creatures in the game. In the game, 
                    as trash and plastic particles are dropped in the ocean, the result would be unhappy sea creatures underneath. 
                    This is showing the visual effects of the consequence of water pollution that is appealing to a wide audience 
                    specifically to kids. Creating a positive awareness and sharing an important message for change.

                    This is a website called spent which is an interactive installation game that shows awareness by providing an experience for the user 
                    to play the spending game. This game shows cases on how people that are unemployed struggle to make ends meet. It also highlights laws 
                    that make their struggles a lot worse than it seems. It is similar to my concept in a way it shows an interactive experience for the 
                    user at the same time teaching them of the current issues that are happening in today’s time in terms of pollution. The difference of 
                    my concept to this example is the theme of my project. I will be focusing on the issue of water pollution while this website has a broad 
                    description of unemployment issues in the US.
